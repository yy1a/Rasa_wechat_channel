    """Transformer Embedding Dialogue (TED) Policy is described in
    https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00486.

    This policy has a pre-defined architecture, which comprises the
    following steps:
        - concatenate user input (user intent and entities), previous system actions,
          slots and active forms for each time step into an input vector to
          pre-transformer embedding layer;
        - feed it to transformer;
        - apply a dense layer to the output of the transformer to get embeddings of a
          dialogue for each time step;
        - apply a dense layer to create embeddings for system actions for each time
          step;
        - calculate the similarity between the dialogue embedding and embedded system
          actions. This step is based on the StarSpace
          (https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03856) idea.
